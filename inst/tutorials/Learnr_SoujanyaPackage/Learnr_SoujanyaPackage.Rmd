## Easy questions

### Exercise 1  3.1-3.3

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

After installing Tidyverse package, given the mpg dataset, plot a scatterplot between any two continuous variable:
**Hint** : *To know what variables are write ?mpg*

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r two-plus-two-solution}
?mpg 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r two-plus-two-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2    3.1-3.3

*Here's an exercise in which you are supposed to ammend the code so that it doesn't show error*

Correct the code and change the color aesthetics to alpha aesthetics mapping it with class attribute:
**HINT**: *print x to view the graph*

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
library(tidyverse)
x <- ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = red)) 
```

```{r add-function-hint}
 # mark the position of '+'
```

```{r add-function-solution}
library(tidyverse)
x <- ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) 
```

```{r add-function-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 3    3.4-3.6

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

First Let's try making facets for our mpg data. Use facet_wrap on any one categorical variable & facet_grid on any two categorical variable. Can you see the difference?
```{r Facet, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r Facet-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
  
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```
```{r Facet-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


### Exercise 4    3.4-3.6

*Labeling is important for both the analyst and for those who use those visualizations*

Let's label the facets we made by putting lab() function
```{r Labeling, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r Labeling-hint}
Use labs()
```

```{r Labeling-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
labs(
  title = "Facet wrap",

```{r q, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r q-hint}
summarise(mean_delay = mean(delay,na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r q-solution}
flights$delay <- flights$arr_delay + flights$dep_delay
summarise(flights, mean_delay = mean(delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r q-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 7        5.6-5.7

*we will be using the nycflights database in these exercises*

In the flights dataset, correct the following code so as to find the flights departed in March and April (why is it wrong?): 

```{r Correct_the_code, exercise=TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
filter(flights, month == (3 |4 ))
```

```{r Correct_the_code-hint}
# Use infix or match operator (%in% or month == 3| month == 4)
# For this answer just use the other one
```
```{r Correct_the_code-solution}
filter(flights, month == 3| month == 4)
```

```{r Correct_the_code-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()

## Intermediate level

### Exercise 1

*Here's an exercise where you would need to apply what you learned. We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code so that the legends of the aesthetics is not shown:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# Horizontal Legend box
library(tidyverse)
x <- ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
show.legend
```
```{r print-limit-solution}
x <- ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class,), show.legends = FALSE)
print(x)
```

```{r print-limit-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Question to verify that one has understood the basics of ggplot:

```{r quiz7}
quiz(
  question("Which of the following modifies a ggplot or theme object by adding on new components?",
    answer("+.gg",correct = TRUE),
    answer("-.gg"),
    answer("/.gg"),
    answer(".gg")
  )
)
```

```{r quiz7-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

```{r quiz8}
quiz(
  question("What are the basic units in the grammar of graphics?",
    answer("Data and layers"),
    answer("Geometries and data"),
    answer("The data, the aesthetics, and the geometries", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Aesthetics and geometries")
  )
)
```
```{r quiz8-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 3

*Where do we use geom_smooth? A linear model can be created on a scatterplot by using this which will be the 'best fit' line or a line average of all the points.*

For the air quality dataset, given the scatterplot, find the 'best fit' line:

```{r airquality, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
airquality
ggplot(data = airquality,aes(y=Wind,x=Temp))+geom_point()
```

```{r airquality-hint}
geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```
```{r airquality-solution}
airquality
ggplot(data = airquality,aes(y=Wind,x=Temp))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```

```{r airquality-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 4

*These questions will be in parts *
Part1: Arrange flights in the order of year, month and day
Part2: Filter Delta flights departed in the month of November and December (carrier is DL)
How many rows are there now?

```{r flights_e, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
?flights
```

```{r flights_e-hint}
# arrange(), inside the braket there could be flights, year, month and day
# filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12) & carrier == "DL")
nrow(filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12) & carrier == "DL"))
```
```{r flights_e-solution}
arrange(flights,year, month, day)
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12) & carrier == "DL")
nrow(filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12) & carrier == "DL"))
```

```{r flights_e-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 5

Make a new variable called delay which will be the total delay from departure to arrival.

```{r delay, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

```{r delay-hint}
flights$delay <- flights$arr_delay + flights$dep_delay
```
```{r delay-solution}
flights$delay <- flights$arr_delay + flights$dep_delay
```
```{r delay-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 6

In the previous question, we made a new variable called delay. Now let's arrange the delay in descending order.
```{r arrange, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights
```

```{r arrange-hint}
arrange(flights, desc(delay))
```
```{r arrange-solution}
arrange(flights, desc(delay))
```
```{r arrange-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 7

*These questions will be in parts *
Part1: Make a new variable called delay which will be the total delay from departure to arrival.
Part2: Since we donot want some variables like arr_time, dep_time etc., let's drop it.

```{r flights, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
?flights
```

```{r flights-hint}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
# select() everything except arr_delay,dep_delay by putting a - before the vector
```
```{r flights-solution}
flights$delay <- flights$arr_delay + flights$dep_delay
select(flights, -c(arr_delay,dep_delay))
```

```{r flights-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 8

Question is in parts.
Part 1: Filter the Delta flights ("DL") for the month November and December.
Part 2: Assign it a new variable name.
Part 3: Find how many hours and minutes was the air time.

```{r ranking, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

```{r ranking-hint1}
# First filter DL flights in only the last month using filter(). Don't forget to use infix %in%
# Save it to filtered_data
# Then use transmute() where hour = air_time %/% 60 and minute is air_time - hour*60
```
```{r ranking-hint2}
transmute(flights,
  air_time,
  hour = air_time %/% 60,
  minute = air_time - hour*60
)
```

```{r ranking-solution}
filtered_data <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12) & carrier == "DL")
transmute(flights,
  air_time,
  hour = air_time %/% 60,
  minute = air_time - hour*60
)
```
```{r ranking-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 9

Find the mean delay of flights given that arr_delay > 30 minutes and find the carrier with the highest delay.


```{r print-limit_s, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}


```

```{r print-limit_s-hint}
flights %>%
	filter(arr_delay > 30) %>%
	group_by(carrier) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_delay))
```
```{r print-limit_s-solution}
flights %>%
	filter(arr_delay > 30) %>%
	group_by(carrier) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_delay))
```
```{r print-limit_s-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

## Advanced

### Exercise 1

Let's do some visualization with the basic knowledge. Questions will be in steps:

Step 1: Find the number of rows and columns of the dataset.

Step 2: Find the table of manufacturers.

Step 3: Make a bar chart to represent the number of manufacturers.

```{r Step1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```
```{r Step1-hint1}
# Use table() and then index the attribute you want to show ($)
```
```{r Step1-hint2}
# geom can take point, smooth, bar etc.
```
```{r Step1-solution}
nrows(mpg)
ncols(mpg)
table(mpg$manufacturer)
qplot(manufacturer, data=mpg, geom="bar", fill=manufacturer) 
```

```{r step1-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2

*Let's discover multiplot Can we draw it using R?*

For iris dataset, form a multiplot. Should we use facet_wrap? or facet_grid? Try to run the code and check.

```{r Multiplotgrid, exercise=TRUE}
#Facet_grid
library(tidyverse)
iris
ggplot(data = iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length))+geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) + facet_grid(Species~.)
```

```{r multiplotwrap, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
iris
ggplot(data = iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length))+geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) + facet_wrap(~Species)
```

### Exercise 3
Missing data in the flights dataset would suggest the flight being cancelled so we would prefer to remove those. Remove all the rows if there is NA in arr_delay and dep_delay.

```{r Remove_missing, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r Remove_missing-hint}
# is.na shows missing whereas !is.na shows not missing
```

```{r Remove_missing-solution}
flights %>% filter(!is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay))
```

```
```{r Remove_missing-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 4

Now that we got the total delay, let's try to find if there is any relation between the distance travelled and delay. If there is any relation then analyze the case for each flight (carrier) using facet.

<img src="C:\Users\hp\Documents\Test Project\seminar class\LearningRepository\Hadley_Exercises\Hadley4rDS_Section5.3\graph.png">


```{r arrange_delay, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights
```

### Exercise 5

Let's remove all the time variables. Can we use any_of to do the same?

```{r Remove, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r Remove-hint}
select(flights, -contains("time"))
```

```{r Remove-solution}
flights
select(flights, -contains("time"))
``

```{r Remove-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

## Aditional Challenge

### Exercise 1
Make a 3D scatterplot to analyse the relation between sepal length, sepal width and petal length.
```{r Challenge, exercise=TRUE,exercise.eval = TRUE}
#install.packages("plot3D")
library(plot3D)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r Challenge-hint}
#Step1 data(iris) & head()
#Step2 Define x,y, and z coordinates. For example, x<- sep.l <-iris$Sepal.Length
#Step3 use scatter3D(x,y,z,clab = c("Sepal","Width(cm)"))
```

### Exercise 2
Find the 5 shortest distance travelled and 5 shortest time taken.

```{r question, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights
```

### Exercise 3
Using flights data, group data by carrier and summarize the data by arr_delay. Finally, plot the summary statistics.

```{r summary_stats, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights
```

```{r summary_stats-hint, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(mean_ardelay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=carrier, y = mean_ardelay, fill = carrier)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_classic()
```
```{r summary_stats-solution}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(mean_ardelay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=carrier, y = mean_ardelay, fill = carrier)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_classic()
```

```{r summary_stats-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```
